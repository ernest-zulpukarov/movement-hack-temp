# Getting Started with Move

This chapter covers concepts that appear in almost every programming language
and how they work in Move. 

> #### Keywords
>
> The Rust language has a set of *keywords* that are reserved for use by the
> language only, much as in other languages. Keep in mind that you cannot use
> these words as names of variables or functions. Most of the keywords have
> special meanings, and youâ€™ll be using them to do various tasks in your Rust
> programs; a few have no current functionality associated with them but have
> been reserved for functionality that might be added to Rust in the future. You
> can find a list of the keywords in [Appendix A][appendix_a]<!-- ignore -->.
