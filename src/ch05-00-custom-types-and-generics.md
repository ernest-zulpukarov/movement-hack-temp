# Custom types and generics

Remember in the first chapter, where you learned about linear types as a safety feature of Move?

In this chapter you'll dig into how those types work to give Move developers Superpowers.

Through real-world examples, you'll develop a solid foundation in programming with

* custom types (structs),
* functions to get and set values of struct fields,
* generics, 
* how generics can constrain type abilities, and 
* generics containing multiple types.
