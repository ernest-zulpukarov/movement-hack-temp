# Domain Modeling

This course encourages you to spend time planning your capstone project. Whether it's a public good, a for-profit dApp or service, or something altogether different, your project should move you. 

You might be envisioning your capstone project as part of a portfolio to help you get a job. Or maybe you want to turn it into a project you release publicly. 

Either way, this chapter will guide you to plan your project's user story and model its domain for the best possible outcome.
