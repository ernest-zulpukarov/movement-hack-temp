# Movement Hack Introduction
 
Welcome to the Movement Hack course, and thank you for your participation! First, we want to introduce you to the new mechanics of this course.

## 1. Quizzes

The main mechanic is **quizzes**: each page has one ore more quizzes about the page's content. We have two rules about quizzes:

1. **Take a quiz as soon as you get to it.**
2. **Do not skip a quiz.**

(We don't enforce these rules, but please follow them! You can get points on Galxe for submitting quiz results!)

Every quiz looks like the one below. Try it out by clicking "Start".

{{#quiz ../quizzes/example-quiz.toml}}

If you get a question incorrect, you can choose to either retry the quiz, or see the correct answers. We encourage you to retry the quiz until you get 100% &mdash; feel free to review the content before retrying the quiz. Note that once you see the correct answers, you cannot retry the quiz.

If you spot an issue in a question, you can submit a bug report by clicking the üêû icon. If you spot any other issue in this book, you can file an issue on our Github repository: <https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/movement-hack>

## 2. Highlighting

Another mechanic is **highlighting**: you can select any piece of text, and either highlight it or leave a comment about it. Once you select some text, click the ‚úèÔ∏è button, and leave an optional comment.

üëâ Try highlighting this text! üëà

You can use highlights to save information for yourself. You can also use highlights to give us feedback &mdash; for example, if you think a section of content is confusing, you can let us know.

> **Note:** your highlights will disappear if we change the content that you've highlighted. Also, your highlights are stored as a cookie. If you block cookies or change browsers, then you won't see your previous highlights.

## 3. ...and more!

The book's content may change as you go through the experiment. We will update this page as we add new features. Here's the changelog:

* March 13, 2023
  * First draft written.
