# Move: The language for digital assets

In this lesson, you'll learn why the Move language was created and what makes Move the ideal language for Digital assets.

Move is a Rust-like language. It was developed in 2020 by the team behind Facebook's Diem project[1]. The goal of Move is to improve how digital assets are managed, making them more secure and efficient.

> ## Why Was Move Created?
>
>Digital assets on the blockchain faced problems like security risks and management difficulties. Previous languages did not fully address these issues. Move was developed to solve these problems by treating digital assets more like physical assets, which helps prevent fraud and errors.

## The Inventors of Move

The engineering team at Diem, which included experts from Facebook, created Move. They used their deep knowledge of blockchain and finance to design a language that meets the needs of the digital economy.

> ## Key Features of Move
>
>- **Resources Concept:** Move uses a concept called "resources" to represent digital assets. This approach ensures that assets cannot be copied or accidentally lost, enhancing their security.
>
>- **Move Prover:** Move includes a verification tool called the Move Prover. This tool checks that Move programs follow the rules and are free from common mistakes, making the programs safer.
>
>- **Compilation into BCS Bytecode:** Move programs are compiled into a format known as BCS (Binary Canonical Serialization) bytecode. This process makes the programs efficient and secure, suitable for various blockchain applications.
>
>- **Flexibility and Scalability:** Move is designed to be flexible, supporting everything from simple transactions to complex financial contracts. It allows developers to create reusable components, promoting an ecosystem of secure and compatible applications.
>
>- **Open Source and Community-Driven:** Move is open source, meaning anyone can see how it works and contribute to its development. This approach ensures that Move can evolve to meet changing needs.
>
## Conclusion

Move is a significant advancement in blockchain technology, offering a secure and efficient way to manage digital assets. Its introduction of resources, combined with the Move Prover and efficient bytecode compilation, makes it a robust tool for developers. Move's open-source nature and flexibility ensure it is well-equipped to support the future of digital finance with security and efficiency at its core.
