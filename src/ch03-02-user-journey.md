A user journey, or user story is a narrative about your dApp, from your dApp user's perspective. It shows their experience with your dApp, step by step.

> ## Chat Room User Story Example
>
> "I went to this site called Move Chat. There were all these messages getting posted, from lots of different wallets. I connected my wallet with a button in the upper right corner. And then I typed in my first message: "Hello, Move!" I clicked Send, signed with my wallet, and my message posted, onto the blockchain! I've been using Move Chat for months now - met several great friends and business partners on there and love the new features they keep adding.
